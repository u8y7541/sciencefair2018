The S&amp;P 500 and Dow just had the worst Christmas Eve session in history.

The Nasdaq and S&amp;P are in bear market, Dow almost there.

The president is tweeting "Poor me" from an empty White House while contemplating firing the Fed chief, which he can't.

Merry Christmas, everyone.

At 52-week lows today: Dow Jones, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, AAPL, GOOG, FB, BABA, NVDA, MU, BRK-A, FCAU, F.

$TSLA is only slightly below its 52-week *average*.

Crazy selloff, but Tesla is 22% above its 52-week low.  That is a sign of strength into Q4 earnings vs. most other stocks.
